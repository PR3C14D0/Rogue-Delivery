# Rogue Delivery
- A Unity 2D game made for a Game Jam that cancelled at de day 2 of three.
- Note that this game is not finished yet. It has been only updated to Unity 6.3 LTS.
  Also note that this project for the game jam was too ambitious that it needed a lot of code 
  written fast. MOST OF THE CODE IS CLEAN.

### Game Jam theme: **WESTERN**

# Special "Features" for being developed in ~48h
- Procedural map generation (some bugs)
- Custom "heat wave" shader with custom URP Features.

## Things to improve
- Stop using singletons (there's only one, but it's nasty)
- Divide many classes into more sub-classes
- Modularity.
- FINISH IT. 

## THIRD-PARTY ASSETS
- Assets will be listed here soon...
